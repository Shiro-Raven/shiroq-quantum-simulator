# ShiroQ Quantum Simulator :cyclone:
This is a simple quantum computer simulator implemented in Python as the screening task for [QOSF](https://qosf.org/)'s Quantum Computing Mentorship Program.

## Pre-requisites
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) (Optional, needed for GPU acceleration)

## Features
- Support for most common single-qubit quantum gates, as well as the Toffoli and Swap gates, along with their controlled versions.
- Support for the parametric R<sub>x</sub>, R<sub>y</sub>, R<sub>z</sub>, and UR<sub>3</sub>.
- Ability to run variational quantum algorithms.
Examples can be found in the __notebooks__ folder.
